AvalonEdit is the name of the WPF-based text editor in SharpDevelop 4.x "Mirador" and beyond. It is also being used in ILSpy and many other projects.

Downloads
-------

AvalonEdit is available as [NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/AvalonEdit). Usage details, documentation and more
can be found on the [AvalonEdit homepage](http://avalonedit.net/)

How to build
-------

AvalonEdit is targeting net6.0-windows, net5.0-windows, netcoreapp3.1, net40 and net45 TFMs. Because of net6.0-windows you must have the .NET 6.0 SDK installed 
on your machine. Visual Studio 2022 Community and up is required for working with the solution (global.json will select the proper SDK to use for building for you).


Documentation
-------

Check out the [official documentation](http://avalonedit.net/documentation/) and the [samples and articles wiki page](https://github.com/icsharpcode/AvalonEdit/wiki/Samples-and-Articles)

To build the Documentation you need to install Sandcastle from https://github.com/EWSoftware/SHFB/releases (currently validated tooling is
v2021.4.9.0)

The build of the Documentation can take very long, please be patient.
