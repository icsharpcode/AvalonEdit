2014/06/28: AvalonEdit 5.0.1-pre
* License changed from LGPL to MIT
* New Feature: Hide mouse cursor while typing (enabled by default)
* New Feature: Highlight current line (disabled by default)
* New Feature: Overstrike mode (disabled by default)
* AvalonEdit now raises the WPF DataObject attached events on clipboard and drag'n'drop operations.
* Encoding detection now distinguishes between UTF-8 with BOM and UTF-8 without BOM. This prevents AvalonEdit from adding the BOM to existing UTF-8 files.
* Improved handling of grapheme clusters. A base character followed by a combining mark is now treated as a single character by the caret movement logic.
* Added RichText, RichTextModel and RichTextColorizer.
* Renamed the VB highlighting mode from "VBNET" to "VB"
* Changed IHighlighter API in order to support SharpDevelop's semantic C# highlighter
* The regex-based highlighting engine was moved into its own class (HighlightingEngine) to be separated from the state-tracking logic in DocumentHighlighter.
* Add FileName property to TextDocument class.
* DocumentChangeEventArgs.RemovedText/InsertedText are now of type ITextSource instead of string.
* Removed the error-tolerant XML parser ("AvalonEdit.Xml"). An improved version of this parser is available as part of NRefactory 5.
* Removed some obsolete APIs.

2014/01/23: AvalonEdit 4.4.0.9727
* Fix Home/End keys to only act on the current TextLine when word-wrapping is enabled, not on the whole VisualLine.
* Remove the caret stop in the middle of surrogate pairs, so that characters outside the basic multilingual plane work as expected.


2013/04/02: AvalonEdit 4.3.1.9430
