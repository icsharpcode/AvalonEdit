	// back to the node. To save memory, the same object is used for both the documentLine and the line node.
	// This saves 16 bytes per line (8 byte object overhead + two pointers).

		// optimization note: I tried packing color and isDeleted into a single byte field, but that
		// actually increased the memory requirements. The JIT packs two bools and a byte (delimiterSize)
		// into a single DWORD, but two bytes get each their own DWORD. Three bytes end up in the same DWORD, so
		// apparently the JIT only optimizes for memory when there are at least three small fields.
		// Currently, DocumentLine takes 36 bytes on x86 (8 byte object overhead, 3 pointers, 3 ints, and another DWORD
		// for the small fields).
		// TODO: a possible optimization would be to combine 'totalLength' and the small fields into a single uint.
		// delimiterSize takes only two bits, the two bools take another two bits; so there's still 
		// 28 bits left for totalLength. 268435455 characters per line should be enough for everyone :)
