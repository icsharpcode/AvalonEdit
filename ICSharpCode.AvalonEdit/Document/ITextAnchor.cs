	/// <summary>
	/// The TextAnchor class references an offset (a position between two characters).
	/// It automatically updates the offset when text is inserted/removed in front of the anchor.
	/// </summary>
	/// <remarks>
	/// <para>Use the <see cref="ITextAnchor.Offset"/> property to get the offset from a text anchor.
	/// Use the <see cref="IDocument.CreateAnchor"/> method to create an anchor from an offset.
	/// </para>
	/// <para>
	/// The document will automatically update all text anchors; and because it uses weak references to do so,
	/// the garbage collector can simply collect the anchor object when you don't need it anymore.
	/// </para>
	/// <para>Moreover, the document is able to efficiently update a large number of anchors without having to look
	/// at each anchor object individually. Updating the offsets of all anchors usually only takes time logarithmic
	/// to the number of anchors. Retrieving the <see cref="ITextAnchor.Offset"/> property also runs in O(lg N).</para>

	/// Usage:
	/// <code>TextAnchor anchor = document.CreateAnchor(offset);
	/// ChangeMyDocument();
	/// int newOffset = anchor.Offset;
	/// </code>
