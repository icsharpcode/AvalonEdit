	/// Thus, the DocumentLineTree may be in an invalid state when these methods are called.
	/// This interface should only be used to update per-line data structures like the HeightTree.
	/// Line trackers must not cause any events to be raised during an update to prevent other code from seeing
	/// the invalid state.
	/// Line trackers may be called while the TextDocument has taken a lock.
	/// You must be careful not to dead-lock inside ILineTracker callbacks.
